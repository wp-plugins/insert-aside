Adds a sidebar comment (an inline box that includes commentary text) to a
post

== Description ==

Often, when a long block of text is being written, secondary content not
germane to the paragraph in question is relevant, but out of scope of a
given paragraph.

       For example, this is text explaining that the author is using
       far too many words to be useful.

This plugin allows users to write [aside]commentary[/aside] and have it
rendered appropriately.
